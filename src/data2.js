      "Dracaena marginata is an attractive, stiff-leaved plant with colorful foliage that sometimes goes by the name dragon tree. Most of the time it’s sold simply as “Dracaena marginata” or just “Dracaena.” These plants are perfect for a beginner gardener because they're very easy to grow indoors. They are tough, drought-tolerant plants with aggressive root systems that make excellent houseplants because they are a little more forgiving than some of the other dracaena. It helps that they’re attractive and varied. Sometimes they are grown as single-stemmed plants; other times grouped or even braided together in the same pot.",

    info:
      "Pothos is arguably the easiest of all houseplants to grow, even if you are a person who forgets to water your plants. This trailing vine has pointed, heart-shaped green leaves, sometimes variegated with white, yellow, or pale green. While pothos likes bright, indirect light it can thrive in areas that don’t get a lot of sunlight or have only fluorescent lighting. It's an excellent plant for locations such as offices and dorm rooms. One advantage of growing pothos is that they are high on the list of plants that can help purify indoor air of chemicals such as formaldehyde, trichloroethene, toluene, xylene, and benzene.",

      "The croton 'Petra' (Codiaeum variegatum 'Petra') is an evergreen shrub native to southern Asia and the western Pacific islands. It prefers hot, humid weather and grows only in U. S. Department of Agriculture zones 9b through 11. In other climates, croton can be grown in containers and kept indoors during cold weather. This distinctive, variegated plant needs special care to stay healthy in all climate zones.",

      "Sansevierias are some of the toughest plants you can find. Whether indoors, in your garden or on your balcony, these spiky beauties can put up with almost anything.They’re easy as can be, but there are a few things you should know. This post is all about Sansevieria, aka Snake Plant, care. You’ll see how low maintenance they really are! These plants are not favored by everyone because of their strong, bold look and tough, pointed leaves.  They’re definitely not the soft, “touchy-feely” kind of plants.",

    info:
      "One of the easiest of all houseplants to grow, red aglaonema is also one of the most stylish. A relatively new variety to the houseplant world, this stunner shows off dark green leaves elegantly flushed with bright red or pink. Its colorful foliage makes red aglaonema a perfect home-decor accent. It's gorgeous on desks or tabletops, as well as coffee tables and side tables in dens, living rooms, and bedrooms. The striking red or pink tones in the foliage also make red aglaonema a fun, stylish alternative plant for the holiday. Consider using it alongside or instead of a poinsettia. Happily, this long-lived houseplant keeps its color and will look good for years!",

    company: "Raptor Forest",
    info:
      "Peperomia is a relatively easy, compact, and attractive little plant to grow. They are neither as striking as Begonias nor as hardy as Dracaena, which may account for their relatively low profile in the world of houseplants. But these plants have all the features we look for in houseplants: variability, interesting leaves, and tolerance for a relatively wide range of conditions. Although it may be tempting to think of Peperomia as succulents, due to their thick, slightly succulent leaves, that would be a mistake because they generally prefer higher humidity and more water than most succulents. In fact, these plants are native to South American rain forests, where they grow quite happily in the loamy, dappled light, cool understory of the rain forest.",

    info:
      "Bold and beautiful, Kimberly queen fern (also called sword fern because the fronds are straight and narrow) is easy to grow. The dark green fronds are perfect for adding tropical texture to shaded decks, patios, and other outdoor living areas. It's particularly striking in large containers as a specimen plant, but also plays well with other shade-loving tropicals including gingers, heliconias, and caladiums. Or, pair it with traditional shade-loving annuals such as New Guinea impatiens, golden sweet potato vine, or begonias. Low-maintenance Kimberly Queen fern grows well both in containers and planted in the ground. It grows 3 feet tall and the mature fronds develop attractive spots (spores) on the undersides of each leaf. Hardy from zones 9-11.",

      "Dieffenbachia is an easy houseplant to grow, and adds a lush, tropical look to the room. This plant’s common name is “dumbcane,” and for good reason: The sap of the plant can cause numbness when touched and interfere with the ability to speak if it gets near your mouth, causing you to temporarily become mute, or “dumb.” Be sure to wear gloves when handling the plant, and keep it away from children and pets.",
